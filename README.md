# Freebeez

Know what’s better than getting free stuff? Getting free stuff without having to talk to anyone! Remember the days when you could put unwanted items on the corner with a free sign and first-come-first-serve it would be taken by some lucky person who happened by? Freebeez takes this idea to the next level by providing a platform for posting and finding free items.

## How to Use
Freebeez is an ios react-native app that has two users; Finders and Givers. 

Finders: As a Finder, you are seeking free items. Simply fire up Freebeez, create an account with your email and share your geolocation, go to the Find page and you are presented with a list of free items! Items are displayed by nearest to farthest from your current geolocation, making ‘shopping’ easy. As the Finder, you are presented with an image of the item, can see how many miles away the item is, click on the map icon to get directions to the item, and are shown an optional item description if one was provided. Once you are within .1 mile of the item, the mileage tracker toggles to the ability to mark an item as taken. Doing so removes it from the Find page so that other Finders are no longer presented with the item. You have the ability to switch the item back to un-taken if for whatever reason you change your mind. Quickly find and take free items, all without talking to anyone!

Givers: As a Giver, Freebeez presents the stage on which to display your free items, ensuring that they find a home quickly and easily. No more dealing with bargaining sites or having to talk to people (so long as it’s free!). Simply sign up for Freebeez with your email and share your location, click on the Give page, and post a new item by sharing at least one image. The rest is done for you. As the Giver, you can upload one to several photos and provide an optional description of your item. The app will automatically populate the item pick-up location for your item (just be sure to post from the location where you’re leaving it!). As the Giver, you will have visibility into your posted items and the ability to mark and item as taken (if the Finder failed to do so). You can also mark an item as un-taken (if a Finder marked it as taken but didn’t actually take it). Freebees will keep your untaken items posted for up to 24 hours, after which time the posting will expire and will be removed from the Find screen. You will be able to see the status of how much time is left on the Give screen. You can repost your item once the timer expires, or if your item was in fact not taken and you’d like to repost, just switch it back to un-taken and repost. Post and give away free stuff, all without having to talk to anyone!

Freebeez users are also presented with an expandable menu from the bottom of the navigation bar that allows them to log-out, as well as go to an about section. Here they can read more about the app and what it does, as well as can report any issues.

Freebeez; giving and finding stuff for free the easy way.

## Feedback


Freebeez is an ios react-native app. One of the biggest challenges with building it was that this is newer technology and as such has less documentation than more established options. One of the biggest challenges that we faced was that ios recently pushed a new version which effectively made much of the little documentation available outdated and incorrect. This meant that you could follow instructions exactly and not achieve the desired result. We especially felt this on getting the image input from Givers. At the end of the day we were agile and switch from the image storage we were planning on using (Cloudinary) to another option (Firebase) as that was more react-native and specifically ios friendly. Room for development includes making the app Android friendly, allowing Givers to edit existing posts (update optional description, add or remove photos), and allowing Finders to favorite items for quick access. 

Our group worked very well together. We made consistent progress with everyone contributing and engaged. We accomplished our goals on time by having an in-depth planning phase where we created detailed user stories which we translated to a Kanban board on Trello. We also maintained a running spec sheet where we documented things like decisions made, future nice to haves, and anything relevant to the project that wouldn’t live on the Kanban or on Slack. We utilized Slack for messaging and for pinning important things such as our project proposal, spec sheet, branding color wheel, etc. Another thing that we found to be very useful on this project was setting up GitHub pull requests to automatically populate in Slack. This gave instant visibility to all team members when a request was made, which could be quickly accessed from the link on Slack, all without the requestor having to send a manual message asking a teammate to approve the pull request. We are pleased to present Freebeez and are excited to continue to build upon this app we are all eager to use!
