# Freebeez

Know what’s better than getting free stuff? Getting free stuff without having to talk to anyone! Remember the days when you could put unwanted items on the corner with a free sign and first-come-first-serve it would be taken by some lucky person who happened by? Freebeez takes this idea to the next level by providing a platform for posting and finding free items. 

## How to Use
Freebeez has two users: Finders and Givers. 

Finders: As a Finder, you are seeking free items. Simply fire up Freebeez, create an account with your email and share your geolocation, go to the Find page and you are presented with a list of free items! Items are displayed by nearest to farthest from your current geolocation, making ‘shopping’ easy. As the Finder, you are presented with an image of the item, can see how many miles away the item is, click on the map icon to get directions to the item, and are shown an optional item description if one was provided. Once you are within .1 mile of the item, the mileage tracker toggles to the ability to mark an item as taken. Doing so removes it from the Find page so that other Finders are no longer presented with the item. You have the ability to switch the item back to un-taken if for whatever reason you change your mind. Quickly find and take free items, all without talking to anyone!

Givers: As a Giver, Freebeez presents the stage on which to display your free items, ensuring that they find a home quickly and easily. No more dealing with bargaining sites or having to talk to people (so long as it’s free!). Simply sign up for Freebeez with your email and share your location, click on the Give page, and post a new item by sharing at least one image. The rest is done for you. As the Giver, you can upload one to several photos and provide an optional description of your item. The app will automatically populate the item pick-up location for your item (just be sure to post from the location where you’re leaving it!). As the Giver, you will have visibility into your posted items and the ability to mark and item as taken (if the Finder failed to do so). You can also mark an item as un-taken (if a Finder marked it as taken but didn’t actually take it). Freebees will keep your untaken items posted for up to 24 hours, after which time the posting will expire and will be removed from the Find screen. You will be able to see the status of how much time is left on the Give screen. You can repost your item once the timer expires, or if your item was in fact not taken and you’d like to repost, just switch it back to un-taken and repost. Post and give away free stuff, all without having to talk to anyone!

Freebeez users are also presented with an expandable menu from the bottom of the navigation bar that allows them to log-out, as well as go to an about section. Here they can read more about the app and what it does, as well as can report any issues.

Freebeez; giving and finding stuff for free the easy way.
